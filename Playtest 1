I have a very first play test today. That is mostly a motivation for me to get everything together and see how it works. My friend Erdir is coming over to see what I have made so far. I know he has a very systematic and mathematical mind, so I am hoping he can give some input on the puzzle. 
I have recently become very disinterested in the classic parts of game design, the parts in which you make a smart puzzle that is tricky but even if it is tricky, it has a solution that the player can find if they try hard. I think of it as the part that potentially makes players feel smart (or stupid). I might want to keep the logic of the behavior ambiguous but I think I should at least try to get beyond the more randomly designed behavior I have right now.
