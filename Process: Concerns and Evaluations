1. I have a few critical evaluations regarding the still-aesthetic of the game (still-aesthetics is the aesthetics of the thing without the movement and the behaviour). ((Footnote: I know aestehtics is a very complicated term, academically. I guess I am using it losely to refer to expression or style)) It seems both a bit too fragile and a bit too pretty. Too catering for the pleasures of the senses.	It has less of an edge than what I usually like. 
I kept telling myself that it is okay that it is pretty because there needs to be something pretty and something not pretty. I have now made the pretty. Congrats I guess. I can now move on. The not pretty must be a response to this.  The non pretty is usually an accident. There is of course accidents in the fimo, it wasn't easy to work with. But these feel to me as cheap accidents. 
Perhaps I am just not used to work with plastic and I am a little grossed out by it. 

Maybe in the end I like the rough molds I made in "natural clay" better than I like the more finalized Fimo versions. Even by the edges the molds are so rough that the light shines through because they dont close properly. I am just realizing this is much more my aesthetic. Maybe I will add these so that there is the combination. The problem with the molds in natural clay is endurance. If they fall down they will shatter. They might even shatter by the vibration from the Virbopixels. 

2. Interaction wise, I would have liked that the rfid chip for the raid sender was embedded in the same object as the Vibropixels. That would mean that the touch and touch attention was not divided between two types of objects. 
The experience would be more cohesive. I wonder if I can find a way of appreciating this clunkiness.  
Would one object with both input and output make it more pretty? Can this clunkiness be a way to make it less pretty? I can’t see it. 
Well, after i had this idea with the rough molds in the natural clay it might make more sense. They dont really seem to invite for touch. If I changed all the eggs to be these molds it would only be the title that invites for touch. Which I kind of like. 

3. Regarding the behaviour: I think there is a tension or a span between how much “game” I want it (meaning that it is possible to find the logic behind the eggs behaviour, aka. there are no randoms.) versus AI (meaning it is a being with behavior that is only partly (or not at all) decipherable). I might take a course in machine learning to get a little grip on how to make indecipherable behavior. 

4. Rhtyhm and time: 
I have an interest at the moment in thinking about games as technologies that arrange us, our bodies, thinking, affinities, fears, etc. in time and rhythms. I was thinking today of this quote from Guattari: "The polyphony modes of subjectification actually corresponds with ways of keeping time." I like this idea of the various rhtyhms that passes through our bodies, often multiple rhythms are passing through our bodies at the same time, modelling us into subjective bodies. For Guattari this is ofcourse a verb not a noun, it is ongoing and does not have an end state.
