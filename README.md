# Variations_II
Variations is a series of prototypes that explore vibration patterns as the main modality of an expressive interface. 
Variations_II is the second iteration. Or, it is practically the third. But as I did not like the first version I had happily fogotten about it when naming the repository. 
Variations uses a vibration technology (Vibropixels) and the Max MSP environment for controlling these. 

This repository is an experiment for my creative process. I consider it a place to have design decisions, concerns, thoughts, images, progress and code in one place.
