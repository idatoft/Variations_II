# Variations_II
This is my very first project on Git. It is first of all an experiment in methods of documentation. The idea being that making games (and art) in an academic context is a huge privilege that i think comes with an obligation, or at least a polite request, to share and be open about the process of making. Similar to how academics who write papers have some kind of obligation to make their knowledge available to the public. This idea of art making as academic practice is rather new and hence we lack established and elaborated methods for documentating and sharing our work. For me, this Git repository is an experiment in public documentation. The "Git-method" is inspired by the documentation work of Pippin Barr <a href=https://github.com/pippinbarr> Pippin Barr</a> as he works for instance in <a href=https://github.com/pippinbarr/tankses>Tankses</a>.
This project of documentation will primarily mean that I am changing a lot of my habits for writing, journaling and keeping track of what I am doing, thinking and what I am supposed to do next. 

<b>Concept</b>
The project I am working on is tentatively called Variations. Variations is a series of prototypes that explore vibration patterns as the main modality of an expressive interface. 
Variations_II is the second iteration. Or, it is practically the third. But as I did not like the first version I had happily fogotten about it when naming the repository. 
Variations uses a vibration technology (Vibropixels) and the Max MSP environment for controlling these.   

<b>Code</b> 
There is a problem with the code (mostly MaxMSP patches)that I just uploaded which is that not all the code is mine. The vibration technology I am using is called Vibropixels and is developed by artist and researcher Ian Hattwick. This means there are a couple of patches which handles the very last step in communicating with the vibropixel devices which are made by Ian and the Vibropixels wont move unless you have these. But I am not sure if I am in a position to share these with you. Which leads me to a following point, that you cannot try out the various iterations of the game anyway unless you *somehow* get hold of a couple of these Vibropixel devices. 

Perhaps the main use of this Git repository is the process notes and if you'd like you can peak into my rather messy Max patches. 

I guess I should add that this is also my first Max project. So, be gentle, please.
