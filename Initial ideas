For Variations_II I wanted to work with ceramics and vibrations. 

The cases that Ian Hattwick developed for the vibropixels were made in silicone, a soft and fun material. It has a nice advantage that it augments the LEDs of the devices. 
The silicone shells however are made to be stripped on bodies in the way that Chris Salter does in his performances. I wanted instead something that is nice to touch, something that feels nice in the hand, and also something that looks pretty when it is not being touched. 
I had initially planned to work with a student from the ceramics program 

to be continued....
