For Variations_II I wanted to work with ceramics and vibrations. Variations_II is part of a series of prototypes (For now named Variations) exploring vibrations and the haptic sense (the sense of touch) as the primary modality for communicating rules, feedback, cues, etc. Basically everything a game needs to communicate. 

The cases that Ian Hattwick developed for the Vibropixels were made in silicone, a soft and fun material. It has a nice advantage that it augments the LEDs of the devices. 
The silicone shells however are made to be stripped on bodies in the way that Chris Salter does in his performances. I wanted instead something that is nice to touch, something that feels nice in the hand, and also something that looks pretty when it is not being touched. 
I had initially planned to work with a student from the ceramics program. I had an attraction to the materials of ceramics and porcelain. To begin with, I found the touch of dry raw clay appealing. Perhaps it is the earthy references that I like to bring into the often syntheticly clean spaces of both galleries and digital entertainment. 
Thinking more about the craft, I started imagining glazed ceramic objects and how they would rest in a museums space with subtle rocking movements when the Vibropixels caused them to rumble. I still have a slight preference for the matt and slightly porous surface but I imagine that a glazed ceramic object will be more lasting against visitors and players potentially dirty fingers. A glistening glazed ceramic object would reflect the light when rocking around which would shift the attention towards the visual rather than the touch. This somewhat goes against the whole ambition to work with the sense of touch rather than the visual sense, however, I might admit that I might have to give away to the visual sense, at least a little bit. I suppose I wonder how little reliance of the visual I can get to.
